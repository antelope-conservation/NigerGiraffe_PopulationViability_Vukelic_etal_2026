- contains R scripts

MSMR_temperature_GZ - Used to perform multistate mark-recapture (MSMR) analysis with temperature as a covariate (temperature is expressed as the number of days with maximum daily temperature equal or above 35°C, excluding December-February period).

GOF_MSMR_temperature - Used to create and export saturated global MSMR model with temperature as a covariate for the goodness of fit  analysis.

MSMR_precipitation_GZ - Used to perform multistate mark-recapture (MSMR) analysis with precipitation as a covariate (precipitation is expressed as total precipitation in months of June, July and August, JJA precipitation, in mm).

GOF_MSMR_precipitation - Used to create and export saturated global MSMR model with precipitation as a covariate for the goodness of fit  analysis.

WA_giraffe_encounter_histories - Encounter histories used in the MSMR analyses are not included in this repository due to data governance arrangements and the conservation status of the West African giraffe. The dataset is collectively owned by the responsible Nigerien authorities and collaborating conservation organisations. Access may be granted upon reasonable request and subject to an appropriate Data Sharing Agreement with the responsible institutions. To request the data, contact the corresponding author.

ERA5_daily_max_T.js
Extracts daily maximum 2 m air temperature (°C) from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset (ECMWF/ERA5/DAILY) for the defined giraffe habitat polygon from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2018. 

CHIRPS_daily_precipitation.js
Extracts daily precipitation (mm) from the CHIRPS dataset (UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/DAILY) for the same polygon and time period.

Users must supply the habitat polygon in Google Earth Engine to reproduce the extraction step.
